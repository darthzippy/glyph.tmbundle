# TextMate Bundle for Glyph


##Installation

To install with Git:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone git@github.com:darthzippy/glyph.tmbundle.git "Glyph.tmbundle"
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

##Usage

###Tab Triggers

Tab triggers are available for the following items:

*	Book (book→|)
*	Chapter (chap→|)
*	Section (sec→|)
*	Frontmatter (matter→|)
*	Bodymatter (matter→|)
*	Backmatter (matter→|)

##Future Development

Development on this bundle is just beginning. For now I've included some basic syntax highlighting and tab triggers for the most common commands.

I am new to Glyph and this is the first Textmate bundle I've created from scratch, so more fetures will be added as I learn more about both.
